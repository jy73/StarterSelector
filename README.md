# StarterSelector
Project Origin : I grew up playing a lot of Pokemon and always struggled to decide on a starter pokemon, so I decided to code a randomizer!

Language: Swift

IDE: XCode

COMMENTS: This is my first app that I've developed and first attempt at using XCode. It's extremely basic and low level, but it's a start? I originally planned to code something a little more substantial but my school workload did not allow :/. So I honestly spent whatever free time I had just watching tutorial videos and messing around in Playground until I finally sat down and put this together. I did use storyboard (which apparently is taboo? IDK lol) and just used very basic coding logic and some png's I found around the internet. Although, I will say that it felt good to be able to put something tangible together and have it on my phone. Definitely looking forward to diving deeper into this and I have a couple ideas on apps I want to work towards making! Please feel free to reach out to me if you have any advice, comments, resources, etc. (jordantyee@berkeley.edu - i'm a first year EECS student so I'd welcome any college/industry/internship/life advice as well :))

BTW new to github as well so I apologize for this horrific README. I'm new to the coding world but I'm loving every minute of it and can't wait to learn more and more!
